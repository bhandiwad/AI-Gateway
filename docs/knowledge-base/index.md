## Tips & Tricks

**Use environment-specific API keys** - Create separate API keys for development, staging, and production to track usage and limit blast radius.

**Enable semantic caching for cost savings** - Similar queries can return cached responses, reducing provider costs by up to 40%.

**Set up alerts early** - Configure usage and cost alerts before you need them, not after you've exceeded your budget.
