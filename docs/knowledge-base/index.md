## Tips & tricks

!!! tip "Use environment-specific API keys"
    Create separate API keys for development, staging, and production to track usage and limit blast radius.

!!! tip "Enable semantic caching for cost savings"
    Similar queries can return cached responses, reducing provider costs by up to 40%.

!!! tip "Set up alerts early"
    Configure usage and cost alerts before you need them, not after you've exceeded your budget.

!!! tip "Use the mock provider for testing"
    The built-in mock provider lets you test without consuming API credits.
